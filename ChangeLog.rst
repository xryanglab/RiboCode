Changes
=======
todo in future versions:
- Supporting for *de novo* GTF file (no annotated start and stop codons).

v1.2.13 (2021.12.26)
-----------------
- Add "--stouffer_adj" option for adjusting cominbed p-values to account for the dependence between two tests (i.e. F0 vs F1 and F0 vs F2)
- Add "--pval_adj" option to correct p-values for multiple testing
- Report alternative annotations of each ORF based on the transcripts other than the longest one (some ORFs in various transcript isoforms but from same gene might be annotated as different types)

v1.2.12 (2021.10.28)
-----------------
- Fixed a small bug caused by an update of h5py; Added a new parameter "--plot-annotated-orf".

v1.2.11 (2018.12.20)
-----------------
- Several small updates.

- Supporting for non-stranded library sequencing
- Update the document

v1.2.9 (2018.3.5)
-----------------
